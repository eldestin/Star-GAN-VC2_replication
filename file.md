## Replication of Star-GAN-VC2 voice-conversion



Refer to [@Samuel Broughton](https://github.com/SamuelBroughton/StarGAN-Voice-Conversion-2), a pytorch implementation is provided.

## Model 

In model notebook, Generator and Discriminator are both implemented.

## Training steps

Here, training all the file here with 90000 step as described in [source paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12279)

## Dataset

[VCC2018](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3061?show=full)

## Result showing

In the following wav file, there is some result converted by myself, where s means source, t means target, o means converted.
